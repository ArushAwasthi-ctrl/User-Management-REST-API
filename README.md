🚀 Just Built My First User Management REST API! Excited to share my latest backend project - a complete User Management System built with Node.js and Express.js! 💻 🔧 Tech Stack: • Backend: Node.js, Express.js • Database: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM • Development: Nodemon for hot reloading • Testing: Postman for API testing • Terminal: Warp (amazing developer experience!) 📋 Key Features Implemented: ✅ Full CRUD Operations - Create, Read, Update, Delete users ✅ RESTful API Design with proper HTTP methods and status codes ✅ MongoDB Integration with Mongoose for robust data modeling ✅ MVC Architecture - Clean separation with Models, Controllers, and Routes ✅ Custom Middleware for request logging and monitoring ✅ Error Handling with try-catch blocks and proper HTTP responses ✅ Data Validation ensuring all required fields are present 🎯 API Endpoints: • GET /users - Fetch all users • POST /users - Create new user • GET /users/:id - Get user by ID • PATCH /users/:id - Update user (last name) • DELETE /users/:id - Delete user • GET /users/name/:first_name - Find user by name 🔍 What I Learned: • Building scalable backend architecture • Database modeling and relationships • RESTful API best practices • Middleware implementation for logging • Comprehensive API testing with Postman • Error handling and validation 📊 User Schema includes: • Personal info (first_name, last_name, email) • Professional details (job_title, gender) • Automatic timestamps for tracking The middleware logs every request with timestamp, HTTP method, IP address, and path - super helpful for debugging and monitoring! 📝 Testing Experience: Used Postman extensively to test all endpoints - from creating users to updating and deleting them. The request logging helped me track every API call for debugging purposes. Warp Terminal Experience: Special shoutout to Warp terminal which made the development process so smooth with its excellent autocomplete and modern interface! 🖥️ This project really solidified my understanding of backend development fundamentals. Already planning to add authentication and authorization as next features! 🔐
